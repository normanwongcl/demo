# Future Todo

Because of time, I will not be able to complete the following optional requirements.

1. Using a production database: The production database I will used will be Planetscale, a managed mysql compatible database: https://planetscale.com/
  - Free till I reach their limits
  - database deployment, backups and scaling is managed by their platform, so I can just focus on development

2. Adding swagger to the project to document the api requests: https://github.com/rswag/rswag
   - I will follow this guide for adding swagger: https://medium.com/@clarkjohnson_85334/adding-swagger-docs-to-a-rails-6-api-using-rswag-a3e8bc577986

3. Refactoring the codebase with design patterns:
   - I currently don't have any experience with design pattern, so I have to study them using this website: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/ruby
